# React Guided Project

This project is part of a guided course on Coursera, where I learned and implemented various React concepts and best practices. The project focuses on creating a Contact Me section with form validation, API integration, and a header with a scroll animation.

## Features

- **Contact Me Section:**
  - Implemented a form with input fields for name, email, type of inquiry, and message.
  - Utilized the useFormik hook for form management.
  - Integrated form validation using Yup schema.

- **API Integration:**
  - Utilized the useSubmit hook to simulate API calls with success and error responses.
  - Displayed success and error alerts using the useAlertContext hook.

- **Header Animation:**
  - Implemented a header with a slide-up and slide-down animation based on the scroll direction.
  - Used useEffect and useRef hooks to handle scroll events and update the header visibility.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Chakra UI
- FontAwesome Icons
- Yup (for form validation)
